content='# Module/Class Name: TaskQueueBase\n\n## Overview\nThe `TaskQueueBase` class is a helper class that provides a standard way to create an Abstract Base Class (ABC) using inheritance. It includes methods for adding tasks to a queue, getting the next task from the queue, marking tasks as completed, and resetting tasks if they were not completed successfully.\n\n## Class Definition\n```python\nclass TaskQueueBase(ABC):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()\n\n    @synchronized_queue\n    @abstractmethod\n    def add(self, task: Task) -> bool:\n        """Adds a task to the queue.\n\n        Args:\n            task (Task): The task to be added to the queue.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the task was successfully added, False otherwise.\n        """\n\n    @synchronized_queue\n    @abstractmethod\n    def get(self, agent: Agent) -> Task:\n        """Gets the next task from the queue.\n\n        Args:\n            agent (Agent): The agent requesting the task.\n\n        Returns:\n            Task: The next task from the queue.\n        """\n\n    @synchronized_queue\n    @abstractmethod\n    def complete_task(self, task_id: str):\n        """Sets the task as completed.\n\n        Args:\n            task_id (str): The ID of the task to be marked as completed.\n        """\n\n    @synchronized_queue\n    @abstractmethod\n    def reset(self, task_id: str):\n        """Resets the task if the agent failed to complete it.\n\n        Args:\n            task_id (str): The ID of the task to be reset.\n        """\n```\n\n## Functionality and Usage\nThe `TaskQueueBase` class is designed to be used as a base class for creating task queue implementations. It provides a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses to define the specific behavior of the task queue.\n\n### Adding a Task\nTo add a task to the queue, you need to implement the `add` method in a subclass of `TaskQueueBase`. This method takes a `Task` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the task was successfully added to the queue.\n\n```python\nclass MyTaskQueue(TaskQueueBase):\n    def add(self, task: Task) -> bool:\n        # Custom implementation to add task to the queue\n        pass\n```\n\n### Getting the Next Task\nThe `get` method is used to retrieve the next task from the queue. This method should be implemented in a subclass of `TaskQueueBase` to define how tasks are retrieved from the queue based on the requesting agent.\n\n```python\nclass MyTaskQueue(TaskQueueBase):\n    def get(self, agent: Agent) -> Task:\n        # Custom implementation to get the next task from the queue\n        pass\n```\n\n### Completing and Resetting Tasks\nThe `complete_task` method is used to mark a task as completed, while the `reset` method is used to reset a task if the agent failed to complete it. Subclasses of `TaskQueueBase` should provide implementations for these methods based on the specific requirements of the task queue.\n\n```python\nclass MyTaskQueue(TaskQueueBase):\n    def complete_task(self, task_id: str):\n        # Custom implementation to mark task as completed\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self, task_id: str):\n        # Custom implementation to reset task\n        pass\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n- It is important to ensure thread safety when implementing the methods of `TaskQueueBase` due to the presence of the `threading.Lock` object in the class.\n- Subclasses of `TaskQueueBase` should provide detailed implementations for each abstract method to define the behavior of the task queue.\n- Consider using the `synchronized_queue` decorator to ensure that the queue operations are thread-safe.\n\n## References\n- Python threading documentation: [Python Threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)\n- Abstract Base Classes in Python: [ABCs in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 835, 'prompt_tokens': 1734, 'total_tokens': 2569}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c2295e73ad', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}
