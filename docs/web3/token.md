## 📣 A Message from the Team

!!! quote
    When we launched $swarms, we believed in radical decentralization.  
    Our team took only **2%** of the total supply — one of the smallest team allocations ever.  
    But this came at a cost.

We underestimated how extreme decentralization can open doors for:
- **Market manipulation**
- **Exchange dominance**
- **Unsustainable development funding**

---

## ⚖️ Our Proposed Solution

We believe in the community — and in **responsible decentralization**. Through **DAO governance**, we propose the following:

=== "Governance Proposals"
- 📈 **Increase team allocation to 10%**  
  To ensure sustainable growth, development, and community engagement.
- 🌱 **Launch a Grants Program**  
  Fuel innovation through Swarms-based agentic projects.
- 🛡 **Fight Market Manipulation**  
  Leverage community voting + on-chain tools to create defense mechanisms.
- 🤝 **Strengthen Community Dev Initiatives**  
  Enable contributors through better tools and incentives.

---

## 🚀 Ecosystem Growth Plans

- **Developer Bounties** via DAO  
- **Agent SDKs** and AI node infrastructure  
- **Liquidity Incentives** to support token utility  
- **Cross-chain compatibility** in future phases
